    question: "Will my child be affected if I apply for knit support?",
    answer:
      "No. Knit ensures your child stays in school. We pay your arrears directly to the school so that your childâ€™s education is not interrupted.",
  },
  {
    category: "Parents",
    question: "How much do I need to pay upfront?",

      "Parents contribute a minimum deposit (usually around 20â€“25%) and repay the balance to knit over agreed instalments.",
  },
  {
    category: "Parents",
    question: "Do you charge interest or fees?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we charge a transparent interest rate and service fee that will always be disclosed upfront before you commit. There are no hidden costs.",
  },
  {
    category: "Parents",
    question: "Will knit check my credit record?",
    answer:

  // Schools
  {
    category: "Schools",
    question: "Is there any recourse if parents donâ€™t repay knit?",

    category: "Schools",
    question: "How quickly do we receive payment?",
    answer:

  {
    category: "Schools",
    question: "How much does knit charge schools?",
    answer:
      "We charge a small arrear protection fee (typically 3â€“5%) on the amounts we settle. This is clearly agreed upfront.",
  },
  {
    category: "Schools",
    question: "Will our school have visibility on repayments?",

  },
  {
    question: "Does my school need to be registered with knit?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: "What are the fees and interest rates?",
    answer:
      "Our fees are transparent and competitive. The exact rate depends on your repayment term and amount. You'll see all fees clearly before you commit to anything.",
