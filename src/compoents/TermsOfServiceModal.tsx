        {/* 4. How Knit Works */}
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. How Knit Works</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Knit settles the agreed amount upfront with the merchant or school. You
          pay an upfront deposit (minimum 20%) and the balance in instalments over
          the agreed repayment term. Payments are collected via DebiCheck debit
          orders or other approved payment methods. No interest is charged on
          arrears protection fees; however, interest and/or admin fees may apply
          where allowed by the NCA.
        </p>

        {/* 5. Fees and Charges */}
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Fees and Charges</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A once-off initiation fee and monthly service fee may be charged, in
          line with the NCA. An arrears protection fee (typically 4%) may apply to
          cover Knit’s upfront payments to the merchant/school. All fees are
          disclosed before you enter into a credit agreement. Fees are subject to
          regulatory caps under the NCA.
